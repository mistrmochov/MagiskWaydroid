Small and quick scripts, that puts finished magisk files to waydroid directory. Fully working Magisk Delta!!
![installedmagisk](https://magiskwaydroid.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/magiskimage.png)

**Purpose of this script.**
Use this scripts if the script from nitanmarcel doesn't work. This script copies "preinstalled" magisk to your waydroid directory. These files are generated from the script, that I mentioned before,I managed to rescue these files from my old HDD
 and I made script based on this so others can benefit. 
 Note: With this script you get only one version of Magisk, which is Magisk Delta 26.3 (Not Kitsune Mask). Magisk Delta fully works and you can install all the sweet stuff and modules you want.

 **Install instructions**
 ```shell
git clone https://github.com/mistrmochov/magiskWaydroid
chmod +x magiskinstall.sh
./magiskinstall.sh (DO NOT RUN AS ROOT OR SUDO, or it wont work)
then press y and you're done
```
 For removal use magiskremove.sh

 **Compatibility**
 These files are for x86_64 architecture, so for arm It propably won't work.
